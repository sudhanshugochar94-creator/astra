## ✨ Key Features & Innovation Pillars

### 👵 1. Elder-First Accessibility & UI
- **18px+ Large Typography & High Contrast:** Designed specifically for age-related visual decline.
- **Voice-First Navigation:** Warm, natural voice guidance in regional dialects for elders with low tech literacy.
- **Low-Frustration Gameplay:** Zero penalizing timers or stressful game-over screens.

### 🌾 2. NER Cultural & Memory Engine
- **Culturally Relevant Games:** Enculturated memory activities incorporating regional festivals (Bihu), Majuli river island lore, tea garden walks, and traditional folk wisdom.
- **Personalized Photo-to-Game Engine:** Converts personal family photos, heirlooms, and audio prompts into interactive recall quizzes.

### 🗣️ 3. 6 Regional Language Support
Native voice and text support powered by Gemini AI for:
- 🌾 **Assamese**
- 🏹 **Bodo**
- 🏔️ **Khasi**
- 🌿 **Mizo**
- 📜 **Nagamese**
- 🌐 **English**

### 🧠 4. On-Device Visual & Motion Engagement Engine
- Analyzes spatial motion differential, head stability, and vocal sentiment strictly on-device in real time without sending camera streams to external servers.
- Automatically adjusts game difficulty and eases cognitive tasks when hesitation or restlessness is observed.

### 🔒 5. 100% Offline-First & DPDP Act 2023 Compliant
- Complete local storage powered by IndexedDB & LocalStorage with **real AES-256 symmetric encryption** (`crypto-js`).
- **Zero Cloud Camera Telemetry:** Camera canvas frames and personal family photos never leave the local client device.
- **Opportunistic Background Sync:** Automatically queues caregiver trends offline (<15 KB payload) and syncs safely when ASHA workers or network connectivity returns.

### 🩺 6. Caregiver & Clinician Portal
- 7-day and 30-day cognitive performance trend visualization (Memory score, Attention, Reaction speed).
- Early alert notifications for sudden cognitive dips or emotional distress patterns.

### 🌿 7. 5-Step Personalized Onboarding & Care Calibration
- **Dual-Role Setup:** Caregivers / ASHA workers configure clinical baseline and statutory consents; elders complete a frictionless 3-question voice check.
- **Auto-Calibrated Accessibility:** Sensory adaptations auto-tune 20px+ typography, contrast, and voice speed.
- **Engagement Continuation Lifecycle:** Configurable 7-day trial, structured 8-week program, or ongoing care with periodic check-in nudges.

### 📚 8. Clinical Evidence & Feasibility Grounding
- Grounded in Cochrane Systematic Review on **Reminiscence Therapy** (*Woods et al., 2018*) and **WHO Dementia Guidelines (2019)**.
- Designed for low-cost Android tablets (< ₹8,000 INR) with bandwidth budget < 15 KB/week for rural North-Eastern deployments.
- Detailed clinical citations and pilot deployment plan available in [CLINICAL_GROUNDING_AND_FEASIBILITY.md](./CLINICAL_GROUNDING_AND_FEASIBILITY.md).
